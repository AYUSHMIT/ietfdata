  This project contains Python 3 libraries to interact with, and access, the
  IETF datatracker, RFC index, and related resources.



Getting started
---------------

  The project uses Pipenv for dependency management. To begin, run:

   ```~~~~~~~~
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

  to create a Python virtual environment with appropriate packages install.
  Then, run:
   ```~~~~~~~~
   pipenv shell
   ```

  to start the virtual environment, within which you can run the scripts.
